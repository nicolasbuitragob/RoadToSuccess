## ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

ETL is a process that extracts, transforms, and loads data from multiple sources to a data warehouse or other unified data repository. 

ETL provides the foundation for data analytics and machine learning workstreams. Through a series of “business” rules, ETL cleanses and organizes data in a way that addresses specific business intelligence needs,  e.g monthly reporting. ETL is often used by an organization to:

- Extract data usually from legacy systems (A legacy system is an informatics system that is antique but is still being used) or from other sources.
- Cleanse the data to improve data quality and establish consistency
- Load data into a target database

In short, the ETL process allows leaving the data in the desired format.

Now, we will talk about what happens in each step of the ETL process.
